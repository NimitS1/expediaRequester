# expediaRequestor
A python wrapper for [Expedia APIs](http://developer.expedia.com/directory)
The goal is to write a developer friendly client that can used to interact with the Expedia API. Once the wrapper is ready, I will publish it as a package in the [Python package index](https://pypi.python.org/pypi)

###Current to-do
- [ ] Complete the API implementation  
- [ ] Populate test cases  
- [ ] Integrate with travis CI
